# GOStat - Open Source Statistics Service

**Note**: This project is created to showcase my proficiency in frontend and backend development.

Welcome to GOStat, a cutting-edge microservice-based application designed to handle HTTP request authentication and statistics with finesse. This project comprises several key microservices, each contributing to its overall functionality and prowess:

- **api_service**: Serving as the gateway for HTTP requests, this microservice orchestrates communication with other components.
- **auth_service**: This microservice is your go-to for authentication tasks, ensuring secure access.
- **stat_service**: Providing robust statistical functionality, this microservice empowers your data-driven insights.
- **app_service**: Seamlessly manage your applications with this dedicated microservice.
- **mail_service**: Need to send emails? Look no further, as this microservice has you covered.
- **client_service**: The frontend, built with next.js, offers an engaging user interface.

All of these microservices are crafted using GoLang. For synchronous communication, they utilize the powerful `gRPC` protocol, while for asynchronous messaging, they leverage `Kafka`. Additionally, they harness the capabilities of the `GORM` ORM library to interact with a `PostgreSQL` database, ensuring data integrity and efficiency.
